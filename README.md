I am Siddanth Palani from the Dept. of Applied Mechanics.
My hobbies are playing chess, badminton, video games (brawl stars).
My favourite thing about Github is the fact that it is versatile and very useful for a collaborative project.
My favourite Python program is the one where we were required to plot a graph of times taken for a binary search and linear search in the lab assignment 2.
